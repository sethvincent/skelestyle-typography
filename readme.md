# skelestyle-typography

just some simple styles I like for basic typography.

you can use it with [rework-npm](https://github.com/conradz/rework-npm):

```
npm install --save skelestyle-typography
```

in your css file:

```
@import "skelestyle-typography";
```

compile with the [rework-npm-cli](https://github.com/sethvincent/rework-npm-cli) module:

```
rework-npm source.css -o bundle.css
```
